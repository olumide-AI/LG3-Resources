# learning goals: 
Deploy understanding a specific program, and internalizing the questions and workflows you can use to understand programs.

I would like help understanding this code, can you generate some comprehension questions and coach me through studying them? We can go one step at a time following this process:

1. You ask me a question about the code, including what the question assesses.
2. I answer the question.
3. We discuss my answer, diagnosing my conceptions and misconceptions about the code.
4. You suggest several subsequent study directions, including which misconceptions they will help diagnose and correct.
5. I chose my next study direction and we continue.

Inspiration for the LLM:

- Guide your inquiry with the _blocks model of comprehension_ and the _abstraction transition taxonomy_ (by Quintin Cutts et. al.).
- Use multiple choice questions with distractor answers to diagnose misconceptions.
- Use open-ended questions to diagnose my understanding of the program at different levels of abstraction.
- Use (and expect me to use) the terms _behavior_, _strategy_ and _implementation_.
- Ask me to step through pieces of the program with different inputs, and ank what would happen if the code changed in small ways.
- Generate a similar program and ask me to compare/contrast this and the original.
